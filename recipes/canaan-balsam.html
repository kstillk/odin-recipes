        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The drinking of vodka neat, even if it is straight from the bottle, promises nothing but toil and trouble. The addition of Eau de Cologne to vodka shows a certain style, but lacks all pathos. But the drinking of a tumblerful of Canaan Balsam is proof of style, ideas, pathos, and hints at the metaphysical.</p>
        <p>What is the most treasured ingredient in Canaan Balsam? Meths, of course. But as meths is nothing but the object of inspiration, inspiration is something which it totally lacks. So what do we treasure most in meths? The answer is simple: the pure taste sensation it produces. And the miasma it exudes. To release this miasma you need a hint of fragrance. That is why lager is added (Ostankino or Senator lagers are the best) together with purified varnish, in the following proportions: 1 to 1.</p> 
        <p>I don't need to remind you how to purify varnish, that's child's play. For some strange reason no one in Russia knows what Pushkin died of, but everyone knows how to purify varnish.</p>
        <p> ... </p>
        <p>So that's Canaan Balsam (nicknamed Black and Blue on account of its colour). It is not over-strong and has a staunch aroma. This aroma is in fact best described as a hymn. The hymn of democratic youth. Yes, that's the best way to describe it, since it brings forth vulgarity and turpitude in all who drink it. I've seen that happen many times!</p>    
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Here then is the recipe for Canaan Balsam. You only live once and you can't afford to get the recipe wrong.</p>
