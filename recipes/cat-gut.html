        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What is the most beautiful thing in life? The struggle for freedom. And what is even mo-re beautiful? This. Take it down.</p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Zhigulev beer — 100 grams</li>
            <li>Shampoo ('Sadko the Rich Merchant') — 30 grams</li>
            <li>Anti-dandruff shampoo — 70 grams</li>
            <li>Mouthwash — 150 grams</li>
            <li>Insect repellent — 20 grams</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Infuse some shag in the mixture and serve.</p>
        <p>I have, by the way, received letters from idle readers, recommending that this mixture be put through a strainer and left standing overnight. What will they think of next! Such additions, corrections and idiotic suggestions are but the products of a flabby imagination and a narrow mind.</p>
        <p>So. Your Cat Gut is ready. Drink it from early evening in large gulps. After two glasses of this, men become so inspired you can spit at them from five feet for half an hour and they won't take the blindest bit of notice.</p>
