        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>But a man who does not want to trample upon the universe should send Canaan Balsam and The Spirit of Geneva to hell. And instead, should make himself The Tear of a Komsomol Girl. This cocktail is strange and smelly. The reasons for its smelliness will become clear later. First I'll explain why it is strange. He who drinks vodka neat keeps a sane mind and a good memory —or loses both. But The Tear of a Komsomol Girl has the oddest effect. After one glass your memory is as strong as ever, but your mind just goes blank. After the second glass the brightness of your mind amazes you, but your memory goes blank.</p>
        <p>Even the recipe for The Tear is pungent. The aroma of the cocktail itself, when mixed, can make you temporarily lose your senses and your consciousness. That's what happened to me.</p>
        <p> ... </p>
        <p>This mixture is stirred for 20 minutes with a honeysuckle twig. There are those who say that dodder can, if necessary, be used instead of honeysuckle. Such an assertion is false and criminal. I would rather be quartered than stir The Tear of a Komsomol Girl with a dodder twig. Only honeysuckle will do. People who use dodder instead of honeysuckle to stir The Tear really make me laugh.</p>
