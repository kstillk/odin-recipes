        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There are two ways of preventing these evil tendencies from coming forth. The first is to abstain from Canaan Balsam. The second is to replace it by The Spirit of Geneva. There is not a drop of honour in this cocktail but what a bouquet it has! And what is the secret of this bouquet? The answer is, I don't know. So what is the solution? The solution lies in toilet water, White Lilac to be precise, which is the ingredient of The Spirit of Geneva for which there is no substitute. Jasmine, Cypress, or Lily of the Valley simply won't do.</p>
        <p>"The world of components has no equivalents," to quote ancient alchemists. They knew what they were talking about. Lily of the Valley simply isn't White Lilac, neither morally nor as regards the bouquet.</p>
        <p>Lily of the Valley excites the mind, troubles the conscience and strengthens one's sense of justice. White Lilac, on the other hand, stills the conscience and reconciles man to the blows of fate.</p>
        <p>I remember once I drank a whole bottle of Lily of the Valley. And then I sat down and wept. Why? Because I remembered my Mother, and I could not put her out of my mind. "Mother!" —I said, and wept. "Mother!"—tears again. A stupid man would have just gone on crying, but I took a bottle of Lilac and drank that. And you know what happened? My tears dried, I was seized by a desire to laugh like a drain and I forgot my mother so completely that I could not even remember her name.</p>
        <p>Now you can understand my contempt for those who make The Spirit of Geneva by adding Lily of the Valley to the anti-perspirant for feet.</p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
