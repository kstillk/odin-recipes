        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Have you had enough time to copy the recipes? Right then, that's enough for now. And when we get to Petushki I promise to reveal the secret of The Waters of Jordan. That's if I get there alive. If God is merciful.</p>
        <p>But first let's put our heads together and think. What can I drink now? What cocktail can I create out of the muck that is left in my little suitcase? Auntie Klava's Kiss? Yes, that is a possibility. My little suitcase can only produce The First Kiss and Auntie Klava's Kiss. Do you want to know what The Kiss is? Simple. A 50-50 mixture of any red wine and any vodka. Dry wine with Pepper vodka or Kuban vodka, for example, produces The First Kiss. Moonshine and a number 33 port make a Kiss Taken by Force, A Loveless Kiss or Inez Armand. There are many such 'kisses' and they'll all make you sick unless you get used to them from childhood.        </p>
        <p>I have some Kuban vodka in the suitcase. But no dry wine. That means that the First Kiss is out and I can only dream. But I do have one and a half small bottles of Rossiyskaya and my fortified ros√© at one rouble 37. And that means that I can have Auntie Klava's Kiss. There's no doubt that its taste is unattractive and that it is absolutely puke-making, more suitable for watering rubber-plants than for drinking straight from the bottle. True, but what else can I do? I have no wine, and no rubber-plant. Nothing for it but to drink Auntie Klava's Kiss.</p>
