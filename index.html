        <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
        <p>(All the recipes listed below are fictional and NOT intended for consumption)</p>
        <p>These are the cocktail recipes from a Soviet underground novel "Moscow Circles" ("Moscow-Petushki", "Moscow to the End of the Line" or "Moscow Stations" in other translations). In my opinion, it is one of the most thrilling, amusing and deep works of the late Soviet literature. It combines an easy, clownlike, unpretentious way of storytelling with a sober and almost academically-smart analysis of the contemporary society, culture and everyday human experiences.</p>
        <p>The main character, Venichka, is an alcoholic dwelling in the absolute lows of the society. However, at the same time he is a well-educated man with an excellent memory. During his trip on a suburban train Venichka comes up with various questions and answers, which lay in the spheres of the classical Russian and world cultures and all the way down to the daily observations of a common Moscow alcoholic.</p>
        <p>I am sure my description of the book is not sufficient for a full understanding of it, thus I include a link to the Wikipedia article below. Also you can easily find the book's full text on Z-library.</p>
        <p>Now, please, proceed to the recipes. Both descriptions and steps are full quotes of what is written in the novel. I hope you will find them amusing and will not try to recreate any of them.</p>
